Repository: /Users/mriechers/Developer/website-analyzer
Design Document: docs/design.md

=================================================
SESSION 1: Initialization - 2025-12-02
=================================================

COMPLETED:
- Generated feature_list.json with 127 comprehensive test cases
- Created init.sh for reproducible environment setup
- Established foundation for long-running autonomous development

FEATURE LIST OVERVIEW:
- Total features: 127
- Breakdown by category:
  * foundation: 22 features (crawler, workspace, snapshots)
  * test-framework: 13 features (plugin system, runner, CLI)
  * migration-scanner: 12 features (first test implementation)
  * llm-optimization: 14 features (LLM discoverability audit)
  * seo-optimization: 19 features (SEO analysis)
  * security-audit: 13 features (security vulnerabilities)
  * issue-tracking: 10 features (persistent issue management)
  * mcp-server: 17 features (Node.js MCP tools)
  * integration: 4 features (end-to-end tests)
  * polish: 3 features (documentation, error handling)

ARCHITECTURE NOTES:
- Two-layer system: Node.js MCP server + Python test runner
- Plugin-based test framework for extensibility
- Project workspace system (projects/<slug>/) for persistent tracking
- Four initial tests: migration scanner, LLM optimization, SEO, security
- Cost-optimized LLM usage (Haiku/GPT-4o-mini for analysis, Sonnet for orchestration)

DEPENDENCIES ESTABLISHED:
- Python 3.11 (required for Crawl4AI and async)
- Node.js 18+ (required for MCP SDK)
- Crawl4AI 0.7.6+ (web crawling)
- Playwright (browser automation)
- @modelcontextprotocol/sdk (MCP integration)

ENVIRONMENT SETUP:
- init.sh verifies Python 3.11, Node.js 18+
- Creates .venv virtual environment
- Installs Python dependencies (crawl4ai, playwright, etc.)
- Installs Node.js dependencies (@modelcontextprotocol/sdk)
- Installs Playwright Chromium browser
- Validates project structure

RECOMMENDED FIRST FEATURE:
Feature #1 (foundation): "Create basic project directory structure (projects/, tests/, mcp-server/)"
- Complexity: low
- Dependencies: none
- Establishes physical project structure for all subsequent work
- Quick win to validate development workflow

RECOMMENDED DEVELOPMENT ORDER (first 10 features):
1. Feature #1: Create project directory structure
2. Feature #2: Implement workspace manager
3. Feature #3: Create metadata.json schema
4. Feature #4: Implement slug generation
5. Feature #5: Create snapshot directory structure
6. Feature #23: Define TestPlugin protocol
7. Feature #24: Create SiteSnapshot data class
8. Feature #25: Create TestResult data class
9. Feature #34: Implement CLI framework (Typer)
10. Feature #6: Implement basic crawler (Crawl4AI)

IMPORTANT NOTES:
- Each feature should be implemented and tested in a single session
- Mark "passes: true" only after verification (manual testing or automated tests)
- Always run init.sh at session start to verify environment
- Commit after each completed feature with descriptive message
- Update this progress log at end of each session

DESIGN HIGHLIGHTS:
- Crawl limits: default 1000 pages (up to 10,000), no depth limit for comprehensive coverage
- Concurrent crawling: 5 requests max, respects robots.txt
- Plugin interface: async analyze(snapshot, config) -> TestResult
- Issue tracking: persistent across runs, auto-resolution detection
- MCP tools: list_tests, list_projects, start_analysis, check_status, view_issues, rerun_tests

COST OPTIMIZATION STRATEGY:
- Local-first: regex/BeautifulSoup before LLM calls
- Batch processing: group similar analysis tasks
- Model selection: Haiku 3.5/GPT-4o-mini/Gemini Flash for analysis
- Expected cost: ~$0.20-$0.40 per 500-page site full analysis

TESTING STRATEGY:
- Unit tests for each plugin
- Integration tests for crawler + test runner
- End-to-end tests via MCP server (Claude interaction)
- Real website validation at key milestones

BLOCKERS: None

NEXT SESSION GOALS:
- Run init.sh to verify environment
- Review feature_list.json
- Implement Feature #1: Create project directory structure
- Begin Feature #2: Workspace manager implementation
- Commit completed work with git

FEATURE IMPLEMENTED:
Feature #2 (foundation): "Implement workspace manager to create/load project directories by slug"
- Complexity: medium
- Status: PASSED

IMPLEMENTATION DETAILS:

Created: /Users/mriechers/Developer/website-analyzer/src/analyzer/workspace.py
- slugify_url(url: str) -> str
  * Converts URLs to filesystem-safe slugs
  * Handles: HTTP/HTTPS, subdomains, ports, paths, query params
  * Examples:
    - https://example.com -> example-com
    - https://blog.example.com -> blog-example-com
    - https://example.com:8080 -> example-com-8080
  * Validation: raises ValueError for empty/invalid URLs
  * Process: parse URL, extract netloc, lowercase, normalize special chars

- ProjectMetadata (Pydantic BaseModel)
  * Immutable design (model_config: frozen=True)
  * Fields: url, slug, created_at, last_crawl, last_test
  * created_at: auto-populated with UTC ISO timestamp
  * last_crawl/last_test: optional, track crawl history
  * Full JSON serialization/deserialization support

- Workspace class
  * Instance methods:
    - __init__(project_dir: Path, metadata: ProjectMetadata)
    - save_metadata(): persist metadata to JSON
    - get_snapshots_dir() -> Path

- Created workspace for: https://blog.example.com:8080 -> blog-example-com-8080
- Loaded both workspaces successfully with full metadata
- Directory structures properly created and validated
- All 44 unit tests passing

FEATURES UNBLOCKED:
This implementation directly unblocks:
- Feature #3: Create metadata.json schema and writer (direct dependency)
- Feature #4: Implement project slug generation (included in this feature)
- Feature #5: Create snapshot directory structure (builds on workspace)
- Plus 10+ downstream features that depend on workspace foundation

RECOMMENDED NEXT FEATURE:
Feature #3 (foundation): "Create metadata.json schema and writer for project metadata (URL, timestamps)"
- Complexity: low
- Dependencies: [2] - SATISFIED
- Enables: Features #6, #7, #8, #14, #15
- Why: Already mostly implemented in ProjectMetadata class
  - Schema is defined and validated
  - Serialization works via Pydantic
  - Just needs structured output helpers

BLOCKERS: None
NOTES: Feature #2 completed efficiently with comprehensive testing. ProjectMetadata model is already designed for Feature #3, so next session should be quick.

SESSION 4: Feature #3 Analysis and Completion - 2025-12-02
=================================================

SESSION PROTOCOL COMPLETION:
1. Read session memory (claude-progress.txt) - Complete
2. Reviewed feature_list.json - Found Feature #3 as target
3. Reviewed git log - Saw 5 commits including Session 2-3 work
4. Ran init.sh - Environment verified and ready
5. Performed smoke test - Project structure and workspace.py confirmed

FEATURE ANALYZED:
Feature #3 (foundation): "Create metadata.json schema and writer for project metadata (URL, timestamps)"
- Complexity: low
- Status: ALREADY SATISFIED BY FEATURE #2

ANALYSIS FINDINGS:

Feature #2 (Session 3) already implements ALL requirements for Feature #3:

1. SCHEMA DEFINITION:
   - ProjectMetadata Pydantic BaseModel (frozen=True for immutability)
   - Fields: url, slug, created_at, last_crawl, last_test
   - created_at: Auto-populated with UTC ISO timestamp + Z suffix
   - last_crawl: Optional, tracks last successful crawl timestamp
   - last_test: Optional, tracks last test name executed

2. JSON WRITER:
   - Workspace.save_metadata() method persists metadata to JSON
   - Uses Pydantic model_dump_json(indent=2) for proper formatting
   - Located at: projects/<slug>/metadata.json

3. SERIALIZATION/DESERIALIZATION:
   - Full JSON → object via Pydantic validation (load method)
   - Full object → JSON via model_dump_json() (save_metadata)
   - Complete round-trip support verified via testing

4. TIMESTAMP HANDLING:
   - ISO 8601 format with Z suffix (UTC indicator)
   - Example: "2025-12-02T23:26:48.739763Z"
   - Auto-generated on creation, can be updated

5. UPDATE CAPABILITY:
   - Metadata can be updated by creating new ProjectMetadata instance
   - Updated metadata persists via save_metadata()
   - Enables tracking of crawl history and test runs

TESTING VERIFICATION:
- Ran full test suite: 44 tests PASSED
- Manual tests: Metadata creation, update, serialization all working
- Verified JSON format matches design requirements
- Verified ISO timestamps with Z suffix
- Verified immutability prevents accidental modifications

DECISION:
Since Feature #3 is already fully satisfied by Feature #2's comprehensive
implementation, no code changes were needed. Simply marked Feature #3 as
passes: true in feature_list.json.

GIT COMMIT:
- Commit: ae15f3c8
- Message: "docs: mark Feature #3 (metadata.json schema) as complete [Agent: coding-agent]"
- Updated feature_list.json only (Feature #3 marked as passes: true)

RECOMMENDED NEXT FEATURE:
Feature #4 (foundation): "Implement project slug generation from URL (normalize domains, handle subdomains)"
- Complexity: low
- Dependencies: [2] - SATISFIED
- Status: This feature is ALREADY IMPLEMENTED in Feature #2
  - slugify_url() function handles all slug generation requirements
  - Tested with 18 comprehensive test cases
  - Should be marked as passes: true in next session

IMPORTANT NOTE:
Features #2, #3, and #4 all appear to have their core functionality already
implemented in workspace.py:
- Feature #2: Workspace manager with create/load - COMPLETE
- Feature #3: metadata.json schema and writer - COMPLETE (verified this session)
- Feature #4: Slug generation - COMPLETE (slugify_url function exists)

Recommend reviewing features #5-#6 for actual implementation work needed.

BLOCKERS: None
NEXT SESSION: Review Feature #4 and #5, likely proceed to Feature #5 or #6
