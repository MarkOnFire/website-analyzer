# Artifacts

This directory contains generated content, exports, reports, and other artifacts produced during project work.

## Organization

- **diagrams/** - Architecture diagrams, flowcharts, system visualizations (Mermaid, PlantUML, images)
- **reports/** - Analysis reports, audit results, performance reports, compliance documentation
- **exports/** - Data exports, configuration snapshots, API response examples, test fixtures

## Usage Patterns

### Naming Conventions
- Use descriptive names with context: `user-flow-diagram-v2.png` not `output.png`
- Include date or version when relevant: `2025-01-api-performance-report.pdf`
- Indicate format clearly: `database-schema.mermaid`, `api-endpoints.json`

### Version Management
- Keep superseded versions temporarily (janitor will archive old versions)
- Use version suffixes for iterations: `architecture-v1.png`, `architecture-v2.png`
- Latest version can omit version: `architecture.png` (if only one current)

### Generated Content
This directory is for outputs that are:
- Generated by tools or scripts
- Exported from external systems
- Created for documentation or communication
- Useful for reference but not source code

## Gitignore Patterns

Some artifact types may be gitignored:
- Large binary files
- Frequently regenerated content
- Temporary exports

Check `.gitignore` for current patterns. Add new patterns as needed.

## Maintenance

The janitor agent maintains this directory:
- Organizes artifacts by type
- Cleans up superseded versions
- Updates .gitignore for new artifact patterns
- Creates indices for large collections

Invoke the janitor when artifacts need organization or cleanup.
